""For project 2024/7537 on the portal, 2 out of 5 files from memoQ, already translated, are failing export apparently due to incorrectly paired tags. However, the tags are correctly paired. I've tried copypasting them and removing them as well, but these did not work. Only the Adult Main ICF and Parental Main ICF are failing, the other files were correctly exported and were also exported after the linguistic steps to the portal. IT seems there was an issue during Revision 1, as the automatic exports for those two files did not upload for that phase and Revision 2.""

Hi Mani,

A couple of issues with the flat file load, it looks like ""UPT 1 matrix mar 21"" was loaded as UPT 1 matrix as both rates are the same.

The rates are also capped at 2 decimal points, I have reloaded both files to extend the decimal points.

Please could you reload both files again.

Kind regards
